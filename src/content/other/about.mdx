I am a Mathematics and Computing major at IISc. 

My areas of interest lie in Representational Learning, Natural Language Processing and Distributed software architecture. 

I have had the pleasure of working on projects in mainly three broad categories: Implementing Deep Learning models such as different types of GAN, VAE, Transformers, etc. from scratch, handling their training and inference, the complete pipeline. Fine-tuning pre-trained models such as YOLO, YAMNet, ResNet, and many more to build interesting application based softwares using frameworks like Langchain, StremLit & Temporal. The last category of projects include building dockerized microservice based distributed applications using SpringBoot Java and Akka, and deployment using Kubernetes.
