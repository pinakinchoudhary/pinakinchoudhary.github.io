Well, You want to about me ? Huh... Okay.

Well, I am just a computer science enthusiast who is passionate about learning and exploring new things, and what else is newer than AI-ML?

I am currently a student at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, pursuing my Bachelor's in Maths & Computing.

This website is a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, and projects. I will compile all my research and learning here, and I hope it helps you in some way (cuz it will definitely help me winkðŸ™ƒ).
