Hello, World!
This is my first Jekyll blog post.

I will be writing about various topics here, which will mostly be things I learn while I explore various courses, projects, books, and research papers in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. It's mostly from courses from Andrew Ng, who is an amazing professor and a great teacher. I will also compile other information I find from various resources into the given topics.

I will try to keep my posts concise and information dense, so that you can get the most out of it, will minimal reading (and a bit more effort on your part, but that's okay, right? 😅).

It's also like a portfolio of my work and a place to share my thoughts and ideas.

I hope you find my posts helpful and informative. 😁

Oh and feel free to email me or contact through any social media platform, if you want to advice me, or vice versa. 

And I mean there's always the comment section if you want to discuss something among the community.
Hope it's a fun journey ahead! 🚀
